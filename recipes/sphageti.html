        <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, sliced - divided</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup sour cream </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix spaghetti sauce into ground beef.</li>
        <li>Place half the slices of butter into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread half the spaghetti into the dish. Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti. Layer remaining spaghetti over creamy mixture. Top with remaining pats of butter.</li>
        <li>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread to cover casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese over casserole and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 more minutes.</li>
    </ul>
